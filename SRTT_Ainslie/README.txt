README

SRTT_AM.m and SRTT_PM.m both require RandomSRTT.m and SequSRTTnew.m to run.
You will also need RandomBlocks.mat if you wish for the Random order of button 
presses to be hard coded. 

SRTTjustpost_AM.m and SRTTjusttrain_AM.m will run the same SRTT_AM script but 
will start from after the breaks. Only use these if the task crashes or if you 
have to stop mid way through for some reason. 

If you have any question please ask Ainslie :)
